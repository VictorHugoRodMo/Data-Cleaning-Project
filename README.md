# Data-Cleaning-Project

#the scrit works directly as asked
# that is to say, first I download the file, then unzip it
# then assign the path for the files to be read
# after that we need to read the files ( asign a variable to them)
# to be sure that the files were readed correctly, we check then ( str (....))
# then we need to determine the best strategy in order to merged the files
# in this case is first to unify the layout, that is to say, bind the files test + train
# after that we are in condition to generate one unifty file.

# then we do as asked, generate the report for st and mean

# The next step asked the activity names in the data set

#At the end we generate the final file and we uploaded to coursera.
